== Welcome to JULIE, version 1.9.0


JULIE is an open-source survey framework for the creation and administration of 
web-based and other computer-assisted surveys. JULIE provides tools to create 
most survey question types as well as specialized tools for the creation of stated 
choice experiments. JULIE is built on the popular Rails web application framework 
and Ruby programming language.


== Release Notes
Version 1.9.0

This is the first version released publicly online.  Generally everything is new.
The most important changes are the following:

* JULIE updated to work with Rails 3.1.0 and Ruby 1.9.2.
* Survenity: an external DSL is used for survey creation.
* Surveys are stored in databases now rather than as Ruby objects.  This also means
  that new database tables were added: Pages, Questions, and Experiments.
* The Surveys database tables has been renamed Responses.
* A Variables tables added which stores a hash of variables associated with a
  respondent's session.
* A Respondents database table has been added which will link the Responses table
  and Variable tables to a particular respondent.
* A new routing system is used during survey progression.
* Updated many, but not all, code to be more consistent.  To have a unifed approach,
  for example, question text will eventually be consistently labeled text everywhere
  rather than text in Survenity and question in the controller.


== Getting Started

(See the wiki at http://www.github.com/mmaness/JULIE/wiki)

To get started with JULIE, you need the following:

* Operating System supported by Ruby (Windows, Mac OS/X, Linux)
* Ruby 1.9.2-p290
* Rails 3.1.0
* SQLite 3.7.3
* Bundler 1.0.18
* Git 1.7.6 (optional)

After installing those components successfully, download the JULIE package from Github 
(https://github.com/mmaness/JULIE/zipball/master OR https://github.com/mmaness/JULIE/tarball/master) 
and unzip/untar it a directory.  It is suggested that you rename the parent directory to "JULIE" 
for consistency with the rest of the instructions.

app
  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.

app/controllers
  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for
  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from
  ApplicationController which itself descends from ActionController::Base.

app/models
  Holds models that should be named like post.rb. Models descend from
  ActiveRecord::Base by default.

app/views
  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like
  weblogs/index.html.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use
  eRuby syntax by default.

app/views/layouts
  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the
  common header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout
  using the <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.html.erb.
  Inside default.html.erb, call <% yield %> to render the view using this
  layout.

app/helpers
  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are
  generated for you automatically when using generators for controllers.
  Helpers can be used to wrap functionality for your views into methods.

config
  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database,
  and other dependencies.

db
  Contains the database schema in schema.rb. db/migrate contains all the
  sequence of Migrations for your schema.

doc
  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when
  generated using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>

lib
  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that
  doesn't belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in
  the load path.

public
  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for
  images, stylesheets, and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the
  default HTML files. This should be set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web
  server.

script
  Helper scripts for automation and generation.

test
  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the rails generate
  command, template test files will be generated for you and placed in this
  directory.

vendor
  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins
  subdirectory. If the app has frozen rails, those gems also go here, under
  vendor/rails/. This directory is in the load path.
